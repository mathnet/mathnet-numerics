redistribution) to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Microsoft from and 
against any claims or lawsuits, including attorneys' fees, that arise or result 
from the use or distribution of your software application.     
Examples of commercial purposes would be running business operations, licensing, 
leasing, or selling the Software, distributing the Software for use with commercial 
products, using the Software in the creation or use of commercial products or any other 
activity which purpose is to procure a commercial gain to you or others.
If the Software includes source code or data, you may create derivative works of such 
portions of the Software and distribute the modified Software for non-commercial

In return, we simply require that you agree: 
1.      That you will not remove any copyright or other notices from the Software.

this license, and you will not grant other rights to the Software or derivative works 
that are different from those provided by this MSR-SSLA. 
4.      That if you have created derivative works of the Software, and distribute such 
derivative works, you will cause the modified files to carry prominent notices so 
that recipients know that they are not receiving the original Software. Such notices 
must state: (i) that you have changed the Software; and (ii) the date of any 
changes.
5.      That Microsoft is granted back, without any restrictions or limitations, a non-
exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, assignable and sub-licensable 
license, to reproduce, publicly perform or display, install, use, modify, distribute, 
make and have made, sell and transfer your modifications to and/or derivative 
works of the Software source code or data, for any purpose.  .

THE LAW PERMITS, NO MATTER WHAT LEGAL THEORY IT IS BASED ON. 
ALSO, YOU MUST PASS THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY ON WHENEVER YOU 
DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE WORKS.
9.      That we have no duty of reasonable care or lack of negligence, and we are not 
obligated to provide any technical support, updates or any other form of support 
for the Software, but if any support or updates are provided (which shall be solely 
in our discretion), they shall be deemed part of the Software and governed by this 
Agreement.  The provision of any Software technical support, updates or other 
support shall in no way be deemed to create any further obligation of Microsoft to 
provide additional support or updates in the future.
10.     That if you breach this MSR-SSLA or if you sue anyone over patents that you think 
may apply to or read on the Software or anyone's use of the Software, this MSR-

Software, not to any derivative works you make.
12.     That the Software may be subject to U.S. export jurisdiction at the time it is 
licensed to you, and it may be subject to additional export or import laws in other 
places.  You agree to comply with all such laws and regulations that may apply to 
the Software after delivery of the software to you.

most nearly captures the intent of the original language.
