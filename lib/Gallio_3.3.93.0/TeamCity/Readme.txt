>>> IF THE AUTO-DETECTION FAILS TO WORK, HERE ARE THE OLD MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS <<<

Only use these instructions if for some reason the auto-detection appears to fail.

Set the RunnerExtensions argument of the Gallio test runner you are using to
    "TeamCityExtension,Gallio.TeamCityIntegration"

    <Gallio RunnerExtensions="TeamCityExtension,Gallio.TeamCityIntegration"
        ... other arguments... />

If you are using the Gallio NAnt task:
    <gallio ... other arguments>
      <runner-extension value="TeamCityExtension,Gallio.TeamCityIntegration" />
      ... other arguments
