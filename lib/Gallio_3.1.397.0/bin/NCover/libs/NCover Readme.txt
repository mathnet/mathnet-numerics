NCover v1.5.8 is included in the Gallio distribution (along with its license file).

The NCover.Console.exe's CORFLAGs have been modified to force it to run as a
32bit process using the Windows SDK corflags command.  It has not been modified
in any other way.

You may also use other versions of NCover if they have been separately
installed on the local machine.
