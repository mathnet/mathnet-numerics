* See also: [Roadmap](http://sdrv.ms/17wPFlW) and [Towards Math.NET Numerics Version 3](http://christoph.ruegg.name/blog/towards-mathnet-numerics-v3.html).
* **Major release with breaking changes**
* All obsolete code has been removed
* Reworked redundancies, inconsistencies and unfortunate past design choices.
* Significant namespace simplifications (-30%).
* Linear Algebra:
   * Favor and optimize for generic types, e.g. `Vector<double>`.
   * Drop the `.Generic` in the namespaces and flattened solver namespaces.
   * F#: all functions in the modules now fully generic, including the `matrix` function.
   * F#: `SkipZeros` instead of the cryptic `nz` suffix for clarity.
   * Add missing scalar-matrix routines.
   * Optimized mixed dense-diagonal and diagonal-dense operations (500x faster on 250k set).
   * More reasonable choice of return structure on mixed operations (e.g. dense+diagonal).
   * Add point-wise infix operators `.*`, `./`, `.%` where supported (F#)
   * Vectors explicitly provide proper L1, L2 and L-infinity norms.
   * All norms return the result as double (instead of the specific value type of the matrix/vector).
   * Matrix L-infinity norm now cache-optimized (8-10x faster).
   * Vectors have a `ConjugateDotProduct` in addition to `DotProduct`.
   * `Matrix.ConjugateTransposeAndMultiply` and variants.
   * Matrix Factorization types fully generic, easily accessed by new `Matrix<T>` member methods (replacing the extension methods). Discrete implementations no longer visible.
   * QR factorization is thin by default.
   * Matrix factorizations no longer clone their results at point of access.
   * Add direct factorization-based `Solve` methods to matrix type.
   * Massive iterative solver implementation/design simplification, now mostly generic and a bit more functional-style.
   * Renamed iterative solver stop criteria from 'criterium' to 'criterion'.
   * New MILU(0) iterative solver preconditioner that is much more efficient and fully leverages sparse data. *~Christian Woltering*
   * Matrices/Vectors now have more consistent enumerators, with a variant that skips zeros (useful if sparse).
   * Matrix/Vector creation routines have been simplified and usually no longer require explicit dimensions. New variants to create diagonal matrices, or such where all fields have the same value. All functions that take a params array now have an overload accepting an enumerable (e.g. `OfColumnVectors`).
   * Generic Matrix/Vector creation using builders, e.g. `Matrix<double>.Build.DenseOfEnumerable(...)`
   * Create a matrix from a 2D-array of matrices (top-left aligned within the grid).
   * Create a matrix or vector with the same structural type as an example (`.Build.SameAs(...)`)
   * Removed non-static Matrix/Vector.CreateMatrix/CreateVector routines (no longer needed)
   * Add Vector.OfArray (copying the array, consistent with Matrix.OfArray - you can still use the dense vector constructor if you want to use the array directly without copying).
   * More convenient and one more powerful overload of `Matrix.SetSubMatrix`.
   * Matrices/Vectors expose whether storage is dense with a new IsDense property.
   * Various minor performance work.
   * Matrix.ClearSubMatrix no longer throws on 0 or negative col/row count (nop)

   * Pointwise power, exponential and natural logarithm for vectors and matrices.
   * Matrix positive-integer power
   * Matrix RemoveRow/RemoveColumn; more efficient InsertRow/InsertColumn
* Native Linear Algebra/Intel MKL:
   * Thin QR factorization uses MKL if enabled for all types (previously just `double`)
   * Sparse matrix CSR storage format now uses the much more common row pointer convention and is fully compatible with MKL (so there is nothing in the way to add native provider support).
   * Providers have been moved to a `Providers` namespace and are fully generic again.
   * Simpler provider usage: `Control.UseNativeMKL()`, `Control.UseManaged()`.
   * MKL native provider now supports capability querying (so we can extend it much more reliably without breaking your code).
   * MKL native provider consistency, precision and accuracy now configurable (trade-off).
   * Native Provider development has been reintegrated into the main repository; we can now directly run all unit tests against local native provider builds. Covered by FAKE builds.

   * Spearman ranked correlation optimized (4x faster on 100k set)
   * Skewness and PopulationSkewness; Kurtosis and PopulationKurtosis.
   * Single-pass `MeanVariance` and `MeanStandardDeviation` methods (often used together).
   * Some overloads for single-precision values.

   * Median direct implementation (instead of R8-compatible 0.5-quantile)
   * New RunningStatistics that can be updated and merged
   * BUG: DescriptiveStatistics must return NaN if not enough data for a specific statistic.

   * New Trigangular distribution *~Superbest, David Prince*
   * Add InvCDF to Gamma, Student-T, FisherSnedecor (F), and Beta distributions.

   * Xml doc and ToString now use well-known symbols for the parameters.
   * Maximum-likelihood parameter estimation for a couple distributions.
   * All constructors now optionally accept a random source as last argument.
   * Use less problematic RNG-seeds by default, if no random source is provided.
   * Simpler and more composable random sampling from distributions.
   * Much more distribution's actual sample distribution is verified in tests (all continuous, most discrete).
   * Binomial.CDF now properly leverages BetaRegularized.
   * BUG: Fix hyper-geometric CDF semantics, clarify distribution parameters.
   * BUG: Fix Zipf CDF at x=1.
   * BUG: Fix Geometric distribution sampling.
   * BUG: Fix Categorical distribution properties. *~David Prince*
* Random Numbers:
   * All RNGs provide static Sample(values) functions to fill an existing array.
   * Thread-safe System.Random available again as `SystemRandomSource`.
   * Fast and simple to use static `SystemRandomSource.Doubles` routine with lower randomness guarantees.
   * Shared `SystemRandomSource.Default` and `MersenneTwister.Default` instances to skip expensive initialization.
   * Using thread-safe random source by default in distributions, Generate, linear algebra etc.

   * Reworked splines, drop complicated and limiting inheritance design. More functional approach.
   * More efficient implementation for non-cubic splines (especially linear spline).
   * `Differentiate2` instead of `DifferentiateAll`.
   * Definite `Integrate(a,b)` in addition to existing indefinite `Integrate(t)`.
   * Use more common names in `Interpolate` facade, e.g. "Spline" is a well known name.
* Root Finding: Chebychev polynomial roots.
* Root Finding: Cubic polynomials roots. *~Candy Chiu*
* Trig functions: common short names instead of very long names. Add sinc function.
* Excel functions: TDIST, TINV, BETADIST, BETAINV, GAMMADIST, GAMMAINV, NORMDIST, NORMINV, NORMSDIST, NORMSINV QUARTILE, PERCENTILE, PERCENTRANK.
* Special functions: BetaRegularized more robust for large arguments.

* Windows: ported windowing functions from Neodym (Hamming, Hann, Cosine, Lanczos, Gauss, Blackmann, Bartlett, ...)
* BigInteger factorial
* Build:
   * FAKE-based build (in addition to existing Visual Studio solutions) to clean, build, test, document and package independently of the CI server.
   * Finally proper documentation using FSharp.Formatting with sources included in the repository so it is versioned and can be contributed to with pull requests.
   * NuGet packages now also include the PCL portable profile 47 (.Net 4.5, Silverlight 5, Windows 8) in addition to the normal .Net 4.0 build and PCL profile 136 (.Net 4.0, WindowsPhone 8, Silverlight 5, Windows 8) as before. Profile 47 uses `System.Numerics` for complex numbers, among others, which is not available in profile 136.
   * NuGet packages now also include a .Net 3.5 build of the core library.
   * IO libraries have been removed, replaced with new `.Data` packages (see list on top).
   * Alternative strong-named versions of more NuGet packages (mostly the F# extensions for now), with the `.Signed` suffix.
   * Reworked solution structure so it works in both Visual Studio 11 (2012) and 12 (2013).
   * We can now run the full unit test suite against the portable builds as well.
   * Builds should now also work properly on recent Mono on Linux (including F# projects).

* Complex: common short names for Exp, Ln, Log10, Log.
* Complex: fix issue where a *negative zero* may flip the sign in special cases (like `Atanh(2)`, where incidentally MATLAB and Mathematica do not agree on the sign either).
* Complex: routines to return all two square and three cubic roots of a complex number.
* Complex: More robust complex Asin/Acos for large real numbers.
* Evaluate: routine to evaluate complex polynomials, or real polynomials at a complex point.

* F# BigRational Reciprocal, Power operator support (**), support for negative integer powers.

* Precision: reworked, now much more consistent. **If you use `AlmostEqual` with numbers-between/ULP semantics, please do review your code to make sure you're still using the expected variant!**. If you use the decimal-places semantics, you may need to decrement the digits argument to get the same behavior as before.
* Much less null checks, our code generally only throws `ArgumentNullException` if an unexpected null argument would *not* have caused an immediate `NullReferenceException`.
* Cases where `ArgumentOutOfRangeExceptions` where thrown with wrong arguments (i.e. no parameter name) now throw `ArgumentException` instead.
* Tests now have category attributes (to selectively run or skip categories).

* Statistics: Empty statistics now return NaN instead of either 0 or throwing an exception. *This may break code in case you relied upon the previous unusual and inconsistent behavior.*
* Linear Algebra: More reasonable ToString behavior for matrices and vectors. *This may break code if you relied upon ToString to export your full data to text form intended to be parsed again later. Note that the classes in the MathNet.Numerics.IO library are more appropriate for storing and loading data.*
* Statistics:
   * More consistent behavior for empty and single-element data sets: Min, Max, Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation etc. no longer throw exceptions if the data set is empty but instead return NaN. Variance and Standard Deviation will also return NaN if the set contains only a single entry. Population Variance and Population Standard Deviation will return 0 in this case.
   * Reworked order statistics (Quantile, Quartile, Percentile, IQR, Fivenum, etc.), now much easier to use and supporting compatibility with all 9 R-types, Excel and Mathematica. The obsolete Percentile class now leverages the new order statistics, fixing a range check bug as side effect.
   * New Hybrid Monte Carlo sampler for multivariate distributions. *~manyue*
   * New financial statistics: absolute risk and return measures. *~Phil Cleveland*
   * Explicit statistics for sorted arrays, unsorted arrays and sequences/streams. Faster algorithms on sorted data, also avoids multiple enumerations.
   * Some statistics like Quantile or empirical inverse CDF can optionally return a parametric function when multiple evaluations are needed, like for plotting.
* Linear Algebra:
   * More reasonable ToString behavior for matrices and vectors: `ToString` methods no longer render the whole structure to a string for large data, among others because they used to wreak havoc in debugging and interactive scenarios like F# FSI. Instead, ToString now only renders an excerpt of the data, together with a line about dimension, type and in case of sparse data a sparseness indicator. The intention is to give a good idea about the data in a visually useful way. How much data is shown can be adjusted in the Control class. See also ToTypeString and ToVector/MatrixString.
   * Performance: reworked and tuned common parallelization. Some operations are up to 3 magnitudes faster in some extreme cases. Replaced copy loops with native routines. More algorithms are storage-aware (and should thus perform better especially on sparse data). *~Thomas Ibel, Iain McDonald, Marcus Cuda*
   * Fixed range checks in the Thin-QR decomposition. *~Marcus Cuda*
   * BUG: Fixed bug in Gram Schmidt for solving tall matrices. *~Marcus Cuda*
   * Vectors now implement the BCL IList interfaces (fixed-length) for better integration with existing .Net code. *~Scott Stephens*
   * Matrix/Vector parsing has been updated to be able to parse the new visual format as well (see ToMatrixString).
   * DebuggerDisplay attributes for matrices and vectors.
   * Map/IndexedMap combinators with storage-aware and partially parallelized implementations for both dense and sparse data.
   * Reworked Matrix/Vector construction from arrays, enumerables, indexed enumerables, nested enumerables or by providing an init function/lambda. Non-obsolete constructors now always use the raw data array directly without copying, while static functions always return a matrix/vector independent of the provided data source.
   * F#: Improved extensions for matrix and vector construction: create, zeroCreate, randomCreate, init, ofArray2, ofRows/ofRowsList, ofColumns/ofColumnsList, ofSeqi/Listi (indexed). Storage-aware for performance.
   * F#: Updated map/mapi and other combinators to leverage core implementation, added -nz variants where zero-values may be skipped (relevant mostly for sparse matrices).
   * F#: Idiomatic slice setters for sub-matrices and sub-vectors
   * F#: More examples for matrix/vector creation and linear regression in the F# Sample-package.
* Control: Simpler usage with new static ConfigureAuto and ConfigureSingleThread methods. Resolved misleading configuration logic and naming around disabling parallelization.
* Control: New settings for linear algebra ToString behavior.
* Fixed range check in the Xor-shift pseudo-RNG.
* Parallelization: Reworked our common logic to avoid expensive lambda calls in inner loops. Tunable.
* F#: Examples (and thus the NuGet Sample package) are now F# scripts prepared for experimenting interactively in FSI, instead of normal F# files. Tries to get the assembly references right for most users, both within the Math.NET Numerics solution and the NuGet package.
* Various minor improvements on consistency, performance, tests, xml docs, obsolete attributes, redundant code, argument checks, resources, cleanup, nuget, etc.

### 2.4.0 - 2013-02-03
* Drops the dependency on the zlib library. We thus no longer have any dependencies on other packages. *~Marcus Cuda, Thomas Ibel*
* Adds Modified Bessel & Struve special functions *~Wei Wu*
* BUG: Fixes a bug in our iterative kurtosis statistics formula *~Artyom Baranovskiy*
* Linear Algebra: Performance work, this time mostly around accessing matrix rows/columns as vectors. Opting out from targeted patching in our matrix and vector indexers to allow inlining.
* Linear Algebra: Fixes an issue around Thin-QR solve *~Marcus Cuda*
* Linear Algebra: Simplifications around using native linear algebra providers (see Math.NET Numerics With Native Linear Algebra)
* F#: Adds the BigRational module from the F# PowerPack, now to be maintained here instead. *~Gustavo Guerra*
* F#: Better support for our Complex types (close to the F# PowerPack Complex type) *~Gustavo Guerra*
